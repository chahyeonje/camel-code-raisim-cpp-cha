CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:13 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "raisim" with any
  of the following names:

    raisimConfig.cmake
    raisim-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "raisim" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "raisim_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "raisim"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
